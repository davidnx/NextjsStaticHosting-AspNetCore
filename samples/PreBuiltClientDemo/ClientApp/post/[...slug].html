<h1>This is the /post/[...slug] page</h1>
<p>
    NOTE: This demo doesn't run any Javscript, so you really should see hardcoded placeholders like <code>[...slug]</code>.
    <br/>
    If this were an actual Next.js app, you could use <code>router.query</code> to render custom content as appropriate.
</p>
<p>It should be returned for requests issued to "/post/{*slug}". For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"/post/123/a"</li>
  <li>"/post/a/b/c"</li>
</ul>
<p>It should NOT be returned for requests such as "/post/123", as that should instead serve page "/post/[pid].html".</p>
<h2>Other places you can go:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/post">Posts index</a></li>
</ul>
