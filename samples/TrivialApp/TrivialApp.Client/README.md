# About this directory

Replace the contents of this folder with your entire Next.js application.

Once you're done, you should have it such that running `npx next export` would populate the nested `./out` folder
with your compiled Next.js application.

The corresponding sample server app (`TrivialApp.Server`) is configured to include the compiled Next.js app outputs when published.
